![maze solver project created for my IA class](https://github.com/emkis/a-star-maze-solver/blob/master/.github/a-star-maze-solver-demo.png?raw=true)

# :page_with_curl: about
the challenge of my AI class in college was to create a maze solver, so i chose **a\*  algorithm** to solve this problem

basically the app **generates randomly a starting point and a destination** point, the algorithm analyzes this distance using **the manhattan distance** and tries to find the **best possible path**

the ui and the whole color palette was based on the cyberpunk universe, because it is beautiful and super cool üòâ

# :hammer: how it was built
this project was developed with the following technologies:

- Vanilla HTML
- Vanilla CSS
- Vanilla JS
- [p5.js (for handling canvas)](https://p5js.org/)

# :electric_plug: how to use
just clone this repo, or download all in a zip and open the **src/index.html** file, thats all
**easy peasy lemon squeezy üçã**

# :information_source: note
all comments in **index.js** file was written in portuguese so that my teacher can read, so ignore it üëΩ

# :memo: license
this project is under the **MIT license**, you can see the **[license](https://github.com/emkis/a-star-maze-solver/blob/master/LICENSE)** for more information.
